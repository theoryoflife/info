<!-- /wp:heading -->


<p><strong>Your privacy is critically important to us.</strong></p>



<p>We do not ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</p>



<p>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, improve services offered to our users, or protect our rights.</p>



<p>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</p>



<p>It is theoryoflife.com’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our app and software applications.</p>



<p>theoryoflife.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. theoryoflife.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how theoryoflife.com’s users use its app. From time to time, theoryoflife.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its app.</p>



<p>theoryoflife.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users interacting with theoryoflife.com's applications. theoryoflife.com only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>



<p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</p>



<p>Certain users to theoryoflife.com’s app choose to interact with theoryoflife.com in ways that require theoryoflife.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that theoryoflife.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users who sign up for any services at theoryoflife.com to provide a username and email address.</p>



<p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</p>



<p>theoryoflife.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on theoryoflife.com’s behalf or to provide services available at theoryoflife.com’s app, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using theoryoflife.com’s app, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. theoryoflife.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, theoryoflife.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when theoryoflife.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of theoryoflife.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an theoryoflife.com app and have supplied your email address, theoryoflife.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with theoryoflife.com.</p>



<p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. theoryoflife.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>



<p>Business Transfers</p>



<p>If theoryoflife.com, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that theoryoflife.com goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of theoryoflife.com may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>



<p>Privacy Policy Changes</p>



<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, theoryoflife.com may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at theoryoflife.com's sole discretion. theoryoflife.com encourages users to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
